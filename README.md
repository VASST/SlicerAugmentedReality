# SlicerAugmentedReality
An extension for Slicer enabling video pass-through augmented reality 

## In development
Current development efforts are focused on the [SlicerCamera](https://github.com/VASST/SlicerCamera) extension to enable stereo capture in Slicer, after which convenience modules will be developed to quickly enter an augmented reality environment.
